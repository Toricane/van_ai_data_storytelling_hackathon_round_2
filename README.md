Inspired by my previous work on https://prajwal.is-a.dev/student_survey/ ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/Toricane/student_survey)), which built 2D visualizations of student survey data, I decided to apply similar techniques to the Vancouver AI Data Storytelling Hackathon Round 2 data. The goal was to create engaging and informative visualizations that highlight key insights from the hackathon survey responses.

### Visualization of Hackathon Data with Embeddings

> [!NOTE]
> The final visualizations are in the [`tsne_visualizations_3d_silhouette_focus_sized/`](tsne_visualizations_3d_silhouette_focus_sized/) directory.
> The code used to generate those specific visualizations is in [`visualizations_3d_silhouette_focus_sized.py`](visualizations_3d_silhouette_focus_sized.py).

Each script below is a checkpoint for creating better and better visualizations to document my work:

1. [`embeddings_of_data.py`](embeddings_of_data.py) - Generates embeddings for hackathon data and saves it to [`hackathon_data_with_embeddings.csv`](hackathon_data_with_embeddings.csv). This file contains the original data along with the generated embeddings for each entry.
2. [`visualize_embeddings.py`](visualize_embeddings.py) - Visualizes the embeddings using t-SNE and saves the output as HTML files in [`tsne_visualizations/`](tsne_visualizations/). This script provides a basic visualization of the embeddings without clustering.
3. [`visualize_embeddings_with_clusters.py`](visualize_embeddings_with_clusters.py) - Visualizes the embeddings with clustering and saves the output as HTML files in [`tsne_visualizations_clustered/`](tsne_visualizations_clustered/). This script enhances the visualization by grouping similar embeddings together, making it easier to identify clusters in the data.
4. [`visualize_embeddings_3d_clustered.py`](visualize_embeddings_3d_clustered.py) - Visualizes the embeddings in 3D with clustering and saves the output as HTML files in [`tsne_visualizations_3d_clustered/`](tsne_visualizations_3d_clustered/). This script provides a three-dimensional perspective of the clustered embeddings, allowing for a more comprehensive view of the data distribution.
5. [`visualizations_3d_silhouette_focus.py`](visualizations_3d_silhouette_focus.py) - Creates 3D visualizations focusing on silhouette scores and saves the output as HTML files in [`tsne_visualizations_3d_silhouette_focus/`](tsne_visualizations_3d_silhouette_focus/). This script emphasizes the silhouette scores of clusters, providing insights into the quality of clustering.
6. [`visualizations_3d_silhouette_focus_sized.py`](visualizations_3d_silhouette_focus_sized.py) - Similar to the previous script but with size variations, saving output in [`tsne_visualizations_3d_silhouette_focus_sized/`](tsne_visualizations_3d_silhouette_focus_sized/). This script enhances the 3D visualization by adjusting the size of points based on their text frequency.

### Data

-   [`Hackathon Round 2_Canada Survey Data.csv`](<Hackathon Round 2_Canada Survey Data.csv>) - Contains the original data from the hackathon.
-   [`characters_to_be_replaced.txt`](characters_to_be_replaced.txt) - A text file containing characters that had to be replaced in the data for better processing.
-   [`survey_questions.pdf`](survey_questions.pdf) - The original survey document used in the hackathon.
-   `hackathon_data_with_embeddings.csv` - The processed data file that includes the original survey data along with the generated embeddings for each entry.
    -   It serves as the input for the visualization scripts. It is not included in the repository because it is 600 MB in size, but it can be generated by running the [`embeddings_of_data.py`](embeddings_of_data.py) script.

### Other Files

-   [`README.md`](README.md) - This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.
-   [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) - Lists the Python packages required to run the scripts.
    -   `pandas`: For loading, manipulating, and saving the survey data in DataFrames.
    -   `numpy`: For efficient numerical operations, especially handling the embedding vectors and size calculations.
    -   `scikit-learn`: Used for dimensionality reduction (`TSNE`), clustering (`KMeans`), and evaluating cluster quality (`silhouette_score`).
    -   `plotly`: The core library for generating the interactive 3D scatter plots.
    -   `openai`: Required for the initial step of generating text embeddings from the survey responses by calling the OpenAI API.
    -   `python-dotenv`: Used to manage your OpenAI API key securely by loading it from a `.env` file.
-   [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) - Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git, ensuring that sensitive or unnecessary files are not included in the repository.
-   `.env` - Contains environment variables for the project, such as API keys or configuration settings.
